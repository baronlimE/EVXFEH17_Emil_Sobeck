        <h4>Midnight AB</h4>
        <p>Midnight AB was a ISP and network design company in the late 1990's. The company consisted of three co-founders
            and some project employes. The main issue of business was to establish a First On Scene foothold as ISP
            in the Kaliningrad conclave. Midnight managed to establish a joint-venture sub company with a local hardware/software 
            support business firm. The main customers consisted of the university, a bank with sub offices, the county
            administrative department and a company-park that housed mainly european companies and firms.
